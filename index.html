    <p>I was born in New Jersey and moved to Texas when I was ten due to my father
        getting a job opportunity here. I worked several retail positions and took
        different college paths after graduating high school. I was a student at UT Arlington
        in the computer engineering program. I took a break from class and the student loans hit 
        so I needed to work as much as I could to pay that while building my nest egg. 
        I have held several retail positions over the course of about 6 years, trying to find that 
        perfect fit.</p>
    <p>During this time, I met a girl and fell in love. We met online and clicked instantly. 
        The only issue, she lives in Norway. I spent a lot of time and effort to try to move 
        there, but I couldn't secure a job due to lack of fluency in the language. Even getting a 
        student visa seemed impossible for the same reason. I took it upon myself to learn the language
        and I am still learning it to this day.</p>
    <p>I am currently a student in the TEKsystems SMU Coding Bootcamp.
        I am hoping to use the skills learned during this course to find
        employment in a tech based field that I am interested in and 
        can also do the most good for others. </p>
